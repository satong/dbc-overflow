### User stories

1.  Users can post questions. Other users can answer them.
2.  Users can comment on both questions and answers. Like StackOverflow, the comments should just be displayed in a flat list.
3.  The user who posted a question can declare one of the user-submitted answers to be the best answer.
4.  Users can upvote and downvote questions, answers, and commentsâ€”only one vote per user for each question, answer, and comment.
5.  Users cannot add a question, answer, or comment or vote unless they're logged in, but they can view all of the above when logged out.
6.  Stretch: Sort answers with the answer selected as the best answer first, followed by the most highly voted. Sort comments chronologically with oldest first.
7.  Stretch: Users can see questions sorted three ways: highest-voted, most recent, and "trending".
